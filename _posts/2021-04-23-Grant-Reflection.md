# Grant Reflection

The grant writing process was something I had never done before. As a biology and psychology major, I knew I may one day write a grant. However, this process really introduced me to the intricacies of composing a grant, even if its focus is on digital humanities. 

As well as being unfamiliar with grant writing, I enetred this class unfamiliar with the digital humanities. I assumed it was some mutant crossover of technollgy and english, and I'm technically not that far off. The digital humanities can be defined **many, many** ways all depending on the viewpoint of the author. To me, the digital humanities is the compiling of research and collaboration of work into technology.

When I was asked to choose a topic for a theoretical grant, I had no idea where to start. I brainstormed what topics in the humanitie sinterested me and came up short at first. I am not into classical literature or art or historical events. After completing the second project review, I knew what humanities subject I wanted to examine: Fan studies. I love fan-written literature and I personally believe it is a highly underrated source of literature.

I specifically wanted to look into creating a project about **Star Wars**. The **Star Wars** universe is very complex and closely examined by superfans and fanfictio writers alike. A problem I have I found in my own examination of the **Star Wars** universe is creating a mental map of the galaxy and keeping track of all the different planets. 

This was the problem I decided to solve with my digital humanities project. I would create an interactive map of the galaxy with each planet referencing the movie and major plot events that occurred there. 

I knew this could be a great undertaking as I have never attempted to code a website in my life, but there are many helpful services to assist in the development of this skill. I was glad this is a theoretical grant and all I needed to do was understand the aspects of the project I would need to request money for. 

In my search of for inspiration, I found a similar project digitizing a small map of the planets mentioned in the first **Star Wars** trilogy. This project was well-made, but I plan take a more detailed approach with my own project. Pictured below is the example project I found.

I would created a map of the galaxy with the planets mentioned in **A New Hope, The Empire Stikes Back,** and **Return of the Jedi**. This comes to a total of 12 planets. Three of these planets are only mentioned and not visited in this trilogy. The visited planets would have a pop-up bubble linked with what important events happened there.

One day I would hopefully exapnd this project to include all 12 **Star Wars** films. 

Before the creation of the grant for this project, I would have confidently stated that an environmental scan delt with the impact a project would have on the environment. This is not true and I instead explained in my environmental scan the state of the field that this project would fit into. I believe this project would be extremely helpful for future fans and fanfiction writers and readers. 

I am very accustomed to scientific writing. I follow a formula and fill in the necssary information to write a pretty boring paper for anyone not interetsed in the research. This grant process has enriched my writing ability by forcing me to become succinct while still giving the needed information. Also, I have enjoyed being able to add personality, which is often not allowed in biological or psychological research. 

This grant process, as well as the digital humanities course, has been a wonderful experience. I feel like I have expanded my writing ability and knowledge of an important subject in this increasingly digital age.
