## Summary

Monroe and Florence Work Today is a digital humanities project focused on the documentation of lynchings in the United States by Monroe and Florence Work. Through his friendships with activists such as W. E. B. Du Bois and Booker Washington, Monroe and his wife Florence were inspired to create an unbiased record of lynchings independent of news reporters. He held very high standards of fact checking before he would include a lynching in his statistics; this standard established his credibility with newspapers across the United States.  

## Design

The project is designed to be used as homework or an in class assignment. There are resources available for students, students of color, and teachers to encourage further discussion of the credibility of the information and personal reactions. The site functions on a mobile device just as well as on a desktop or laptop. The project is broken into two informational parts separated by an interactive map. The first part gives background on Monroe and Florence, defines lynching, and background on eight additional reformists who worked on lynchings. The interactive map shows a colored dot representing the race of the individual who was lynched. One flaw is the map shows some dots where the individual was lynched, while some dots are where the mob arose. The second part of the site presents questions that students should keep in mind after looking at the project.

## Relevance 

The project is well designed while still being respectful of a sensitive topic. The directors include links to an active twitter account for the project and contact information for teachers to send reviews of the project. The information presented in the project is supported with factual evidence and also encourages viewers to question where the project's credibility comes from. 

## Credit 

The project was created by Plaintalk History as a compilation of data from credible secondary sources. The project has been updated to 2021 through collaboration with a scholar at Yale. The original sources are held at the Tuskegee University Archives. 

## Findings 

Monroe and Florence Work Today is very informative of the lives of Monroe and Florence Work, as well as their contribution to records of lynchings. The site is simple to use with all links to further information clearly marked. The site features eerie music when scrolling down the lynching tab, but there is no source to pause or stop the music. The links included in the explanations are marked as quotes and are very useful for providing additional viewpoints or definitions. The photos at the bottom of the iceberg are very small and could be better viewed if clicking on them made them larger.

Overall, the project is well-made and shows great care to be informative yet still accessible to students. Although, the site could be considered difficult to use for someone not interested in completing the lesson. Some steps must be completed in order to access certain aspects of the project. The project is a magnificent tool for teaching students about Monroe and Florence Work and their contribution to lynching records.
